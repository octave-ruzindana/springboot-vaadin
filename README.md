# springboot-vaadin
Todo list app with spring boot and vaadin 11
#Evaluation
## Productivity

## Maintenability
 - Not so good (at least with java only approach)
  - Depends heavly on developer's own code organisation.
  - No strict guidelines where to put components, views, services,... (as in angular for exemple)
  - Heavy usage of listeners and lamda can make it hard to follow code workflow
 ## Security
 - Not tested yet

## Scalability

## Internationalisation
 - easy with spring and properties file

## Learning

 - Great
  - Needs to know java 8 (especially )
  - Official Documentation is quite good 
 - Not so great
  - Not much help outside of official doc (stackoverflow,..), specially for the last version (vaadin 10 and ongoing)
